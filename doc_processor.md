- Context: This After-Action Report pertains to a communications training session during the Core Tasks phase of Advanced Skills Training. The author, CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT, makes several key observations and recommendations to improve the structure and content of said training.

- Key Findings: 
   - The training sufficiently covers core topics, but there's a sacrifice of breadth and depth for essential topic retention. 
   - The importance of communications to the career field is undermined by the limited time and resources dedicated to it.
   - Some communication skills like SINCGARS waveforms and kit construction were not covered.

- Lessons Learned: 
   - More time should be allocated to essential training.
   - Valuable skills are being overlooked in the training curriculum.
   - Practising the same type of frequency has diminishing returns. 

- Recommendations: 
  - Extend the communications training by at least five additional days.
  - Include SINCGARS waveforms and kit construction in the curriculum.
  - Maintain high-pressure training but ensure it remains respectful.
  - Implement a higher standard for troubleshooting training, with a specific process.
  - Diminish repetitiveness by diversifying frequency types.

- Relevant Supporting Details: 
  - The training fails to teach certain skills such as SINCGARS waveforms, vehicular communications, field expedient antennae, and kit construction. 
  - Unprofessional conduct occurred during the high-pressure training.
  - Troubleshooting education for hardware was lacking, despite good programming troubleshooting instruction.
