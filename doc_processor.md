  "Date": "22 October 2015",
  "Type": "MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD",
  "From": "CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT",
  "Subject": "After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase",
  "Purpose": "The purpose of this memorandum is to make suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of communications training during the CT phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST).",
  "Overview": "Communications training in CT is intense, thorough, and well taught. It covers all the 'must have' subjects, but this block still isn't given the time the subject deserves. We are sacrificing breadth and depth in order to ensure retention of the essentials -- which is the right decision, given the constraints. Given the importance of communications to the career field (especially in today's wars), we are under-resourcing this training.",
  "Observations and Recommended Improvements": {
    "Scope of Curriculum and Training Days Allocated": {
      "Discussion": "Only 10 training days were allocated for this training. It doesn't build on what was taught at CCS -- it repeats it and surpasses it. This meager investment in time stands in contrast to the importance of communications to the career field: no matter what mission a CCT is asked to perform, communications are the *sine qua non*. Without the ability to communicate, a CCT is at best a rifleman.",
      "Recommendations": "Expand this training by at least 5 days.",
      "Details": "We are not teaching SINCGARS waveforms, although this is the primary means of secure transmissions among ground combat formations in the US Army and Marine Corps. HAVEQUICK is taught instead: this is important for communications with aircraft (UHF frequencies of 225-400 MHz), but is rarely used between ground units because UHF requires line of sight."
    },
    "Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting": {
      "Discussion": "Instructors made a concerted effort to ramp up the pressure on students, teaching them to troubleshoot under pressure. Although it did border on disrespectful at times (which should be avoided), increasing the stress level is an excellent policy. Students definitely felt the pressure and it highlighted the importance of the communications skillset.",
      "Recommendations": "Keep up the pressure, but also keep it professional. Include a training event to teach troubleshooting to a higher standard"
    },
    "Repetitiveness": {
      "Discussion": "Practice makes permanent, and we did a good job of giving students the experience they needed on the fundamentals. That said, we approached a point of diminishing returns pretty quickly on hand-jamming basic VULOS frequencies. By TD4, we weren't getting a good return on investment from the time put into it.",
      "Recommendations": "Less of the same type of frequency. Adding SINCGARS will help."
