MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

FROM: CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT

SUBJECT: After Action Report (AAR) for Combat Control School Class 3-15

ATTACHMENTS: (1) Suggested Fires Curriculum for Combat Control School

1.  **Purpose**. The purpose of this memorandum is to make suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of Combat Control School (CCS).

2.  **Overview.** Although there are certainly opportunities for incremental improvement, CCS is accomplishing its mission to a high standard. Under the leadership of CMSgt Innis and the daily personal example of SMSgt Rosendale, the staff exhibits a culture of passionate, personally-committed instruction. This is an accomplishment by itself, and even more noteworthy when considering the intense demands placed on the cadre in terms of hours and energy. The net result of the events, tone, and structure of the course is to create the dedicated, focused, unbreakable warriors that the community needs.

> These successes, however, are hindered by outdated curriculum: it needs to be reviewed and overhauled. The staff needs reinforcement, and equipment needs to be replaced. Officer-specific training is a problem as well. We are not giving them the leadership training and experience they need to meet the school's requirements, much less the training their peers receive in other branches of service.

3.  **Observations and Recommended Improvements.**

<!-- -->

a.  ITEM: Demolitions Block of Instruction

<!-- -->

(1) DISCUSSION: Demolitions is the only block of instruction that isn't testable for the remainder of the course. While the block itself was very well taught in both classroom and practical exercise, it had no relevance to the remainder of the course.

(2) RECOMMENDATIONS: Because of the infrequency with which Combat Controllers and Special Operations Weathermen employ demolitions in real world operations, demolitions should be considered an advanced skillset. Remove it from the 3-level course and combine it with the existing demolitions curriculum at Advanced Skills Training. Use the training time gained at CCS to expand truly fundamental skillsets (as suggested below).

<!-- -->

b.  ITEM: Marksmanship

<!-- -->

(1) DISCUSSION: CCS weapons training expends a staggering amount of ammunition in a short amount of time. We are right to fund it so thoroughly, as the value of personal weapons proficiency is highlighted in almost every AAR from the current fight. However, marksmanship training is like combat: you cannot gauge effectiveness by how many rounds were shot.

> We are doing a great job of training weapons handling and malfunction clearance, but we are not training marksmanship at all. We are not teaching accuracy, nor testing it.
>
> The 'crawl' stage of marksmanship consists of fundamentals like sight picture/sight alignment, breath control, trigger squeeze, and then seeing how these factors influence marksmanship in the most controlled circumstances possible -- the known-distance (KD) range. Instead, we are teaching from the 'walk' stage and higher; this continues the trend I noticed from Combat Control Selection Course.

(2) RECOMMENDATIONS:

    a.  Marksmanship deserves at least an uninterrupted week of training. Take the week that is currently demolitions, and use the whole thing for rifle marksmanship. Include, at a minimum, a KD range and individual hit markers per round from distances of not less than 200 meters -- actual distance, not simulated indoors.

    b.  Focus on the time-honored fundamentals during CCS: students are not ready for combat marksmanship yet.

    c.  Hire a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to create and run a new marksmanship program of instruction. Consider a USMC Infantry Warrant Officer ("Gunner"), or a Master Gunnery Sergeant with a Reconnaissance background. (See Paragraph 3.j for more on this staffing recommendation.)

<!-- -->

c.  ITEM: Land Navigation

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: The land navigation classroom curriculum was the most thorough and effective I've seen in my 16+ years of experience in land, air, and sea navigation. The instruction was equally good: Mr. Williams in particular deserves recognition for a job well done.

> The practical application portion was effective, but the points were sometimes difficult to find by virtue of where the card was located. The distances between points were effective in testing and training physical fitness, but also diluted the training value somewhat. Students had relatively few opportunities to learn the skills before being tested on them.

(2) Recommendation:

    a.  Ensure that points are visible for students who have successfully navigated to the right area: there were times that I stood less than 2m from the sign-in card but couldn't see it.

    b.  Shorten the legs, but increase the number of them. Maintain the aggregate distance moved per day.

    c.  Equip students with drinking straws for their 2-qt canteens. SFAS equips its students at Camp MacKall in this manner because it reduces the opportunity cost of hydration, and in doing so increases the frequency of water consumption. If we do this, heat injury rates will fall.

<!-- -->

d.  ITEM: Fire Support Objectives during Tactics

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: Fire support curriculum was badly organized, outdated, overbroad in scope, and lacked the details needed for this stage of a controller's development. For how important this skillset has been over the past 15 years of combat, we aren't weighting it appropriately at CCS.

(2) Recommendation: See enclosed slides labeled "3-level fires syllabus rough draft" for a suggested curriculum.

<!-- -->

e.  ITEM: Stress Inoculation Training (SIT)

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: The value of SIT cannot be overstated, and it is aptly named: it imbues trainees who complete it with the resilience that will enable mission success on the battlefield, and assist our warfighters in returning home with their mental health intact. It also serves to ensure that airmen who continue in training are nearly unbreakable in mind, body, and dedication.

> Operational risk management (ORM) was excellent. It's difficult to push men to their limits without also endangering them, but the staff's skill in planning and supervision ensured that both safety and difficulty were achieved to the maximum extent possible. The only event that needs improvement was the litter carry on the shoulders -- it requires a twisting motion of the lower back while under heavy weight, especially among teams with height disparities.
>
> Changes in student leadership were designed to increase stress and give leadership experience to younger students. Unfortunately, the effect was to deprive student leadership of badly needed development opportunities, as well as credibility with their men.

(2) Recommendation: Continue to make SIT a grueling, arduous, effective, unpredictable, yet safe evolution. Change some details in the litter carry event to match the 'Down Pilot' event at Special Forces Assessment and Selection. There, they provide students with heavy iron pipes to make an "H" frame, with weight in the center. The workload is actually increased over the current event, but because the weight is centered on the spine the chances of injury are reduced.

> Discontinue the practice of changing student leadership at random -- make the leadership do their job under stress, for the duration of the course.

f.  ITEM: Performance Review Board

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: When students are meeting objective requirements (e.g. written test, practical examinations) but not meeting subjective standards (e.g. attitudes, behavior, teamwork), CCS leadership rightly makes the decision to roll them back or eliminate them from training. When students fall a bit short on objective requirements, there is no process in place (that I'm aware of) to allow them to continue in training despite not meeting the standard.

(2) Recommendation: Put more power in the hands of CCS cadre/leadership by creating a transparent Performance Review Board (PRB) to formalize the process of using their judgment about who should, and who should not continue in the career field. Take reports from previous pipeline schools into account. Also take peer evaluations into account, per the following bullet.

<!-- -->

g.  ITEM: Peer Evaluation System

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: We don't have a system to tie together peer observations throughout the pipeline. We need one -- especially if we are going to incorporate peer opinions into decisions about eliminating men from the career field. The software already exists (employed at SFAS/Q-Course) and with minimal effort could be tailored to our community.

(2) Recommendation: Look at the peer review software used at SFAS, and tailor it to use for our community. Use it to track his performance (in the eyes of those who see him the most - his peers) from the time a trainee starts at CCSC until he graduates AST at STTS.

<!-- -->

h.  ITEM: Water Confidence Training

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: Water confidence training was simply outstanding. I have seen variations of it from three branches of the military, and Dan Kaster is hands down the best instructor I've ever seen. (He's also one of the best mentors for young warriors.)

> However, the standards got so high -without a hard requirement to pass the events- that we induced learned helplessness in at least two students (Airmen James and Harris) who went on to SIE at Pre-SCUBA, beret already in hand.
>
> The eggbeater tread was superfluous training; treading with fins is the test at pre-SCUBA.

(2) Recommendation: Make water confidence tests a mandatory gate that must be passed to continue in the course. This is going to help students overcome their fear, by giving them no other choice at a time when they are already in the habit of conquering fears. Also, lower the standards: the distances and times should be about the same as Week 1 standards at Pre-SCUBA. Remove eggbeater treads, add fins and weights. Conduct a bi-annual TDY of STTS pre-SCUBA cadre to CCS IOT ensure expectations are synchronized.

<!-- -->

i.  ITEM: Officer Training

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: Officers aren't being given the formal training they need to understand the mission planning process. The depth at which it is taught at CCS is appropriate for junior enlisted personnel, but certainly not for the officers and probably not for the NCOs.

(2) Recommendation: Conduct formal training on mission planning as a pre-req for CCS -- see ATC AAR.

> A note about observations from other classes: I didn't see this during my own CCS class, but I noticed this trend elsewhere in the pipeline and every STO lieutenant I've spoken with related the same experience from CCS. I hope they have the courage to speak about it in their AARs, but I'll mention it in mine as a backup.
>
> Younger cadre members are quick to assume that a lieutenant's questions, failures, or hesitations are a result of lack of desire, compliance, or a bad attitude. They are used to a high standard of leadership from their officers, but the youth, inexperience, and student status of the lieutenants gives them unrealistic expectations of their abilities. While bad attitudes are sometimes the case, more often than not the lieutenant simply doesn't know how to do any better. Instead of beating them for being young, we need to teach them.
>
> This is a serious problem in the pipeline; our young officers are being stripped of their authority in public. It inclines them to be hesitant, indecisive, and meek; the exact opposite qualities that we want in our STOs! It has a tremendously negative impact on their ability to lead in the future. We need to specifically prohibit the unfortunately common practice of degrading their authority in public. Insulting them, their abilities, or their leadership, is NEVER acceptable. I recommend that 24SOW/CC himself address this issue, in person, with pipeline cadre.
>
> I am not suggesting that we go easy on our officers -- far from it. It is right to exact the highest standards from them, make them carry the most weight (literally and metaphorically), and to address any shortfalls firmly.
>
> But before cadre assumes that a failure is the result of a bad attitude, they need to pause and remember that these are very young men who need their teaching, mentorship, and guidance much more than they need to be disciplined. Encourage cadre members to take a personal stake in the leadership abilities and competence of the Lieutenants they graduate. They should be proud of their role in developing them into officers who are worthy of the authority that their rank automatically gives them.

j.  ITEM: Instructor Manpower

<!-- -->

(1) Discussion: The quantity (and difficulty) of time in the field is very difficult on the instructors, and there appears to be a constant struggle to meet minimum instructor ratios (MIR). At the same time, there are not enough SMEs on small unit tactics (SUT) at the schoolhouse: Eric Page (whose value to the school cannot be overstated -- a truly excellent instructor whose subject matter expertise and passion are unsurpassed) is the only native expert on the subject we have.

(2) Recommendation: Add a tactics instructor who is an expert in SUT. Consider a joint partner from a Ranger regiment, Marine Reconnaissance or Infantry Warrant Officer background.
