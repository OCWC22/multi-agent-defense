Sir-

Attached is a draft of my AAR for RUT, which I will submit this Friday. I would like your guidance on my choice of words in my last bullet. The firm tone is intentional.

Some additional bullets for an ANGLICO internal audience:

Comm training.

Gear

Integration with maneuver forces. Per my AAR, we spent 90% of our time on comm training. Much of this was because we simply had no experience in a tactical environment as a team, and comm was quickly exposed as a critical vulnerability. We badly need to practice realistic mission sets, integrated with maneuver forces. After that, comm training will take care of itself as chiefs and team leaders hone in on their weaknesses.

I recommend sending our top communicators to advanced field expedient antenna training. I don't know what MARSOC offers, but the 18E course at Ft. Bragg would be absolutely ideal. The goal should be to develop a resident base of knowledge, and regularly exercise it.
