**After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase**

**Context:**
This After Action Report is intended to capture observations and recommendations following the communications training phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST) conducted on 22 October 2015 under the guidance of Captain Jeffrey D. Wright. The focus is on assessing the effectiveness and suggesting improvements for the communications training element, which plays a crucial role in military operations.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Scope of Curriculum and Time Allocation:**
   - Only 10 training days were allocated, which is insufficient for thorough coverage of communications topics critical to operations.
   - Essential topics such as SINCGARS waveforms and advanced antenna techniques were not adequately addressed.

2. **Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting:**
   - Instructors successfully increased the pressure on students to simulate stress in operational environments; however, this sometimes bordered on disrespectful.
   - Instruction on troubleshooting hardware was found lacking compared to programming troubleshooting.

3. **Repetitiveness in Training:**
   - The repetitive nature of training on basic VULOS frequencies reached a point of diminishing returns, indicating a need for varied practice.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Effective communications are vital for operational success, and adequate training resources must reflect this necessity.
- Increasing pressure in training scenarios is beneficial for learning, but it must be balanced with professionalism to maintain respect and morale.
- Diversification in training frequency practice is crucial to ensure meaningful learning and retention.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Expand Training Duration:**
   - Increase the allocated days for communications training by at least 5 days to enhance curriculum breadth and depth.

2. **Enhance Curriculum Content:**
   - Include instruction on SINCGARS alongside HAVEQUICK.
   - Cover topics such as field expedient and directional antennae, and ensure comprehensive training on HF communications using the VRC-110 system and PRC-150.

3. **Maintain Instructor Pressure, Yet Professionalism:**
   - Continue to utilize stress in training scenarios, but ensure it remains respectful and constructive.
   - Initiate higher standard troubleshooting training through the establishment of practical problem-solving exercises with broken gear for students.

4. **Reduce Repetitiveness:**
   - Limit the repetition of similar frequency training to avoid diminishing returns on learning.

**Relevant Supporting Details:**
- Depending on mission requirements, communication proficiency is the backbone of operational success; neglecting its training represents a critical risk.
- Structured troubleshooting training events can build confidence and competence under pressure, better preparing students for real-world challenges.
