MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

FROM: CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT

SUBJECT: Combat Control Selection Course (CCSC) After Action Report

1.	The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the 342d Training Squadron Commanding Officer and 24th Special Tactics Wing leadership with a comprehensive report on the Combat Control Selection Course from the perspective of an experienced student.

2.	Overview: I attended CCSC from 28 May 2014 through 10 June 2014.  We started with 29 assigned and graduated with 15; 1 more quit after graduation.  Attrition came mostly from PAST test failures: 6 failed the initial test and 4 failed the exit test.  We lost 1 Airman to injury, 1 to Self-Initiated Elimination (SIE) during a run, and 2 to SIE on the morning of Training Day (TD) 5.

3.	General Observations 

a.	ISSUE: Conduct of Cadre

(1)	DISCUSSION:  CCSC cadre's conduct exemplified the highest standards of military professionalism.  By example, they served as a lesson in how professional warfighters should conduct themselves.  They successfully balanced the need to maintain professionalism against the need to impose stress and to force students into questioning their motivation.  

(2)	Cadre adopted a tone between events that allowed students ask questions about the career field and learn about the cadre's own experiences.  The students learned a great deal from these informal interactions, and the openness enabled classroom sessions to be a truly interactive learning environment.  These informal discussions significantly increased student motivation and conviction.

(3)	RECOMMENDATION: Commend CCSC cadre on setting a professional tone, serving as excellent role models, and giving a great first impression of what it means to be a Special Tactics airman.  

b.	ISSUE: Safety

(1)	DISCUSSION:  Only one airman was lost due to injury, which is proof of the course's excellent planning and operational risk management (ORM).  Every time I started to note signs of heat exhaustion among the team (or felt them in myself) the cadre had a planned cooling stop shortly thereafter.  These ORM tools were leveraged to support the course's mission; timelines were given to get back into formation after cooling down in a creek, crawls through culverts became exercises in accountability, helping one's teammates, etc.  Students had regular, plentiful access to sports drinks, ice, and water.  Cadre aggressively monitored student hydration to ensure it was accomplished.

(2) RECOMMENDATION.  Commend cadre and maintain status quo.

c.	ISSUE: Course effectiveness and difficulty.

(1)	DISCUSSION:  The course was very tough, but due to its short duration the mission of selecting the right men for the job was incomplete.  For the time allotted, the course was as effective as it could be.  The men were constantly exhausted, sore, and aware that yet more awaited.  Those that succeeded were forced to consider the difficulty still to come in the pipeline, but decided to push forward anyway.  Most found the fortitude to do so, and this is a factor of the course’ structure.  Instead of killing hope by front-loading the difficulty (and thereby teaching helplessness), CCSC taught those who succeeded that they were capable of incredible feats of endurance – if they so choose.  During the most difficult part of some events, I saw individuals make that crucial decision to be tough; one by one, it ‘clicked’ that endurance is a choice.  Most (but not all) who did not learn this lesson were eliminated.  Those without the physical capabilities were identified as well and screened out even if their hearts were in the right place.  Some remain who are still on the proverbial fence – they were able to ‘hang on’ because the course duration was just not long enough.

(2) RECOMMENDATION:  Because this course does an incomplete job of screening and selecting (due to the short course duration), senior leadership should discuss whether it is desirable for follow-on courses to complete the process of selecting the right men.  If not, expand the length and scope of this course in order to remove the burden of screening and selecting from other pipeline schools. 

Continue the habit of teaching toughness by building upon early success.  Maintain the high physical demands of the course at their current levels.  Protect cadre and course curriculum from any attempts to soften, dilute, or lessen the severity of the training.  Consider increasing the psychological difficulty of the course by employing oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and CS gas during “grass and gorilla” drills, “The Mogadishu Mile”, and similar evolutions.

4.	Deficiencies
a.	ISSUE: Aquatic Training Facilities.  

(1)	DISCUSSION:  CCSC utilized the Chaparral and Skylark pools aboard main side Lackland AFB.  The facilities were adequate for the training; however, the opportunity costs to transport CCSC students to these pools are significant.  At least an hour per day (about 10% of the usable training time for the course) was consumed by loading the bus, driving to the pool, and recovery to the Lackland Training Annex (LTA).  Some sessions felt rushed as the next group of Battlefield Airman Students were waiting for our session to be completed.  

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Conduct an analysis of the costs in manpower, training hours, and financial outlay on transportation associated with driving to main side Lackland for aquatic training.  Compare this to the cost of constructing and maintaining a dedicated aquatic facility aboard LTA.  We may be able to conduct better training while also saving money, due to the opportunity costs associated with commuting to main side.  This recommendation is doubly important with the addition of water confidence to CCSC curriculum.  

b.	ISSUE: Gym Facilities

(1)	DISCUSSION: There is no purpose-built gym for students aboard LTA; all facilities are improvised and temporary in nature.  The Forbes hall gym was used for most of the functional fitness evolutions.  Even for small groups, the low ceilings prevented certain kinds of exercises and were a safety concern.  For groups of 15 or more, efficiency was lost as airmen had to wait on space or equipment to be available.  Instructor creativity (such as putting exercise equipment in hallways and designing workouts to keep much of the group outside at any given time) mitigated the problem, but the impact of insufficient facilities was still a major hindrance to mission accomplishment. The “Battle” gym was far more spacious but it could still barely accommodate a full sized group due to the incompatible design of the original construction.  

(2) RECOMMENDATION: Construct purpose-built gym facilities aboard LTA.

c.	ISSUE: Dining Facility (DFAC)

(1)	DISCUSSION: LTA DFAC was adequate, but needs improvement.  Many training hours were lost while changing into an acceptable uniform for lunch, marching to the DFAC, marching back, and changing again.  Prices were rarely displayed – several times I observed students who had selected a meal in excess of $15 but didn’t learn that until at the register.  Credit cards are not accepted: an obstacle for those on TDY status.  Juice dispensers were present but never functional.  Glasses were usually dirty.  Seating area for students 'in team' was not clearly delineated and oftentimes we were not able to sit together, which impeded cohesion, coordination, and efficient return to training.  

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Provide boxed lunches to CCSC students in order to prevent training time from being squandered on changing uniforms, moving personnel to and from the DFAC, and trying to rush through (and thereby not eating properly) during peak hours.  Prices need to be prominently displayed for all items at all times.  Accept credit cards.  Fix/stock juice dispensers.  Evaluate effectiveness of dish washing equipment.  Place signs on tables dedicated for ‘in team’ student use.  

d.	ISSUE: Barracks aboard LTA.
(1)	DISCUSSION: Barracks were generally in a good state of repair and police, but some standard operating procedure changes could be implemented to keep them this way.  Every day, BA students return to the barracks with filthy uniforms but there are not ‘wash racks’ to provide an initial rinse/dry before they are put in the showers and laundry.  There is no internet connection in the barracks – as a result, most students pay $40-$80 per month out of their pocket to enable data tethering from their cell phones, or purchase a mobile-to-WiFi device.  Floor drying fans on second deck are broken.  

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Construct ‘wash racks’ outside the barracks, with associated air-drying facilities.  Good models to copy can be found at NDSTC in Panama City, BUD/S in Coronado, and TBS in Quantico.  For a small investment, a lot of long-term money will be saved on broken laundry machines and clogged plumbing, to say nothing of quality of life and sanitation.  Provide wireless internet in the barracks.  Until wash racks are constructed, cadre need to brief the importance of pre-washing soiled uniforms before using laundry facilities.  Conduct survey of drying fans – repair/replace damaged assets.  

e.	ISSUE: Preventative maintenance of “Grass and Gorillas” (G&G) area.

(1)	DISCUSSION: The ditch in the middle of the G&G field is an obvious hazard to students, but trimming the grass closely allows students to judge their footing much better than having the guess at microterrain obscured by taller grass.  Additionally, the slippery slope leading to the creek leads to many falls, and injury is narrowly avoided during every evolution.    

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Trim the grass in the ditch at least weekly.  Drive a few stakes in the ground to give students something to hold on to while scrambling up and down the hill to the creek.  When one considers the financial cost and operational impact of losing a single student due to a preventable injury, a few hundred dollars spent on ORM is certainly worth the benefit.    

f.	ISSUE: Command Climate in the Barracks: Military Training Leaders and Student-Out-of-Training (SOT) leadership.

(1)	DISCUSSION:  Bluntly put, there is a leadership crisis in the barracks.  The climate I observed is prejudicial to the development of good military order and discipline; I am concerned that our men are learning bad habits at a very formative time in their careers.  At best, the students exhibit a tolerant attitude towards the Military Training Leaders (MTLs) and ‘green ropes’ – and in uglier cases, the attitude is outright disrespectful, dismissive, and even dominant over them.  This is breeding a collective mindset of insubordination towards authority, disrespect for non-SOF personnel, disregard for policy, and the desire (and ability) to get away with breaking rules by daring those in charge to enforce them.  The way it manifests at LTA is in incredibly petty, but these are the little things among trainees that tend to grow into major problems later on.

The root of the problem is that daily life in the barracks is controlled by personnel that cannot effectively lead our airmen (MTLs), and quitters/failures that have been given authority over their former teammates (green ropes).  MTL ineffectiveness is not a function of individual ability or lack of training; it is a result of the tremendous cultural gap between the modal Air Force NCO and the attitudes prevalent in the Battlefield Airman community even among our pipeline students.  This is not a problem that can be solved by simply telling the battlefield airmen to behave; they already are, given the circumstances.

Adding to the problem, students that quit or fail are not segregated from those who are succeeding.  Some are even given leadership positions (‘green ropes’) over their former teammates.  Attitudes are contagious; although most successful students use the SOTs as close-range case studies in how not to behave, the net effect of housing SOTs and SATs together is still to drag down the morale, focus, and mentality of the successful ones.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Give responsibility for the barracks to the Battlefield Airman cadre.  They know the men and the mission better than anyone else.  Leverage them to instill high standards of military discipline among the students.  MTLs should not be set up for failure: use them as agents of the cadre, but do not expect their authority to stand on its own.  Physically segregate the SOTs from the SATs to the largest degree possible.

g.	ISSUE: Evening accountability during CCSC

(1)	DISCUSSION: Students had to stay awake until evening accountability formations.  This cut into their sleep time.  Especially on weekends, students had their sleep cycles significantly disrupted by this administrative constraint.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: While students are ‘in team,’ do not require them to attend evening accountability formations.  Enforce noise discipline after 20:00.

5.	Internal Course Improvements

a.	ISSUE: Injury Prevention

(1)	DISCUSSION: Adequate time to warmup and stretch was not always available.  As this course is the student’s first real exposure to military athletics, it is not reasonable to expect them to have the knowledge and habits necessary to conduct an internally-driven warmup.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Build in warmup/stretch time to the schedule.  Cadre should conduct the warmup/stretch sessions initially in order to show students what right looks like.  Transition to student-lead warmup by the end of the course with cadre members serving in a coaching/supervisory role.

b.	ISSUE: Academic materials

(1)	DISCUSSION: Material covered by the slides seemed to be outdated, and incomplete in some cases.  Written materials were rife with typographical and grammatical errors.  Student learning was not adversely affected due to the excellent delivery of the periods of instruction – but even the instructors noted that the materials needed improvement.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Review the quality, relevance, and consistency of written materials (slide decks and handouts).

c.	ISSUE: Timelines

(1)	DISCUSSION: When the class was given a show time for an event, it was not treated as an inviolable ‘hard time.’  This is a missed opportunity to stress the importance of timeliness, time management, and small unit organization.  The current generation of students grew up without wristwatches – it’s more important than ever that we teach them that making time hacks to the second is non-negotiable.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: Anytime a timeline is given, cadre should ruthlessly enforce being on time – reinforce the notion that seconds count.

d.	ISSUE: Examination/instillation of physical aggressiveness in a combat context.

(1)	DISCUSSION: (Note: this is from my perspective as a Marine Corps Martial Arts Instructor).  CCSC students are entering a profession that entails ground combat at close range.  To ensure they can act with lethal aggression when required (and to protect their long-term mental health), it’s important that they learn early on how to access the aggression required to kill and then return to a level mindset just as quickly.

(2)	RECOMMENDATION: If additional training time becomes available, consider adding a combatives component to the course.  If no time is available, consider adding a pad/dummy striking component to a functional fitness or G&G workout – for example, start a fireman’s carry with 10 standing knees to a pad, or end a race with ground-and-pound on a dummy.
