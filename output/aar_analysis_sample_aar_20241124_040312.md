## Analysis Results

Mission Overview:
Radios are an indispensable part of the mission, no matter what it is. Communications training in CT is intense, thorough, and well taught but this training block is under-resourced despite the importance of communications to the career field. 

Key Lessons Learned:
- Without the ability to communicate, a CCT is at best a rifleman.
- The training scope needs expansion and depth.
- Troubleshooting needs more emphasis during the training phase.
- Repetitive practice on the same type of frequency is not improving the learning outcomes.

Critical Action Items:
- Expand the allocated training days by at least 5 days.
- More subjects need to be included in the curriculum such as SINCGARS waveforms, field expedient antennae, directional antennae, vehicular communications, high frequency, kit construction, and wave propagation theory. 
- Instructors should maintain professionalism when applying pressure on the students.
- Troubleshooting training needs to improve.
- Practice should include more variety of frequencies, that is, less of the same type of frequency.

Precautions:
- Stress levels due to instructor pressure should be kept within respectful limits.
- Troubleshooting training should not only cover programming but also include hardware.
- CCTs need to be able to simultaneously shoot, move, and communicate using their individual kit.

Recommendations:
- Expand the training by at least 5 days.
- Teach the aforementioned uncovered topics.
- Instructors should continue applying pressure on students but maintain professionalism.
- Hold special training events to teach troubleshooting to a higher standard.
- Add more variety of frequencies for practice such as SINCGARS.

Relevant Supporting Details:
- CCTs perform various missions where communication is the vital factor.
- Physical training evolutions that require students to shoot, move, and communicate are required to test the viability of their individual kit.
- Practice doesn't only make perfect but creates permanency. Students need ample experience with fundamentals. However, more variety should be incorporated into their practice.
