## Analysis Results

**After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase**  
**MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD**  
**FROM:** CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT  
**DATE:** 22 October 2015

**1. Purpose**  
The purpose of this memorandum is to make suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of communications training during the CT phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST).

**2. Overview**  
Communications training in CT is intense, thorough, and well taught. It covers all the "must have" subjects, but this block still isn't given the time the subject deserves. We are sacrificing breadth and depth in order to ensure retention of the essentials -- which is the right decision, given the constraints. Given the importance of communications to the career field (especially in today's wars), we are under-resourcing this training.

**3. Observations and Recommended Improvements**  

**a. ITEM: Scope of Curriculum and Training Days Allocated**  

**(1) DISCUSSION:** Only 10 training days were allocated for this training. It doesn't build on what was taught at CCS -- it repeats it and surpasses it. This meager investment in time stands in contrast to the importance of communications to the career field: no matter what mission a CCT is asked to perform, communications are the *sine qua non*. Without the ability to communicate, a CCT is at best a rifleman.

We are not teaching SINCGARS waveforms, although this is the primary means of secure transmissions among ground combat formations in the US Army and Marine Corps. HAVEQUICK is taught instead: this is important for communications with aircraft (UHF frequencies of 225-400 MHz), but is rarely used between ground units because UHF requires line of sight.  
Field expedient antennae, directional antennae, vehicular communications, high frequency, and kit construction were not covered. Wave propagation theory was not covered in sufficient depth.

**(2) RECOMMENDATIONS:** Expand this training by at least 5 days.  
Continue to teach HAVEQUICK, but also teach SINCGARS. Teach field-expedient and directional antennae. Teach the VRC-110 system, et al. Teach the PRC-150 for medium-range HF communication: the most recent combat employment of Naval Surface Fire Support was by a USAF CCT, so it's easy to show that this is within the scope of our duties.  
Make sure that teams have a full complement of kit issued to them before the start of CT. Developing kit that allows the user to simultaneously shoot, move, and communicate takes a lot of time and testing. It also requires connectors, cables, antenna relocation kits, zip ties, and the knowledge about how to make it all come together. Create physical training evolutions that require students to shoot, move, and communicate in order to prove the viability of their individual kit.

**b. ITEM: Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting**  

**(1) DISCUSSION:** Instructors made a concerted effort to ramp up the pressure on students, teaching them to troubleshoot under pressure. Although it did border on disrespectful at times (which should be avoided), increasing the stress level is an excellent policy. Students definitely felt the pressure and it highlighted the importance of the communications skillset.  
The instruction on how to troubleshoot programming was good; instruction on troubleshooting hardware was lacking.

**(2) RECOMMENDATIONS:** Keep up the pressure, but also keep it professional. Include a training event to teach troubleshooting to a higher standard. This can be done in the following manner:

a. Direct radio repair shop to keep a separate stash of broken gear, with a tag for what's wrong with it.  
b. Set up 1 station per student, using one or more items of broken gear. Radios can be programmed correctly or incorrectly to add more difficulty. Students have their own reliable gear with them, which they can swap out to fix the problems.  
c. Students must troubleshoot the radio's programming and attached hardware to find the deficiency or deficiencies.  
d. Radio checks are student's number plus what deficiency (or deficiencies) he corrected.  
This kind of event is a great way to build confidence and ensure calmness when things go wrong.

**c. ITEM: Repetitiveness**  

**(1) DISCUSSION:** Practice makes permanent, and we did a good job of giving students the experience they needed on the fundamentals. That said, we approached a point of diminishing returns pretty quickly on hand-jamming basic VULOS frequencies. By TD4, we weren't getting a good return on investment from the time put into it.

**(2) RECOMMENDATIONS:** Less of the same type of frequency. Adding SINCGARS will help.
