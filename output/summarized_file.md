**After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase**

**Context**  
DATE: 22 October 2015  
FROM: CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT  
SUBJECT: After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase

**Purpose**  
The purpose of this memorandum is to make suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of communications training during the CT phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST).

**Key Findings**  
1. Communications training is intense, thorough, and well taught but does not have adequate time allocated to cover essential content effectively.
2. Only 10 training days were allocated for communications training, which lacks the necessary depth and breadth, considering the criticality of communications in combat operations.
3. Important subjects such as SINCGARS waveforms are not being taught adequately, while alternative methods like HAVEQUICK are prioritized without sufficient justification.

**Lessons Learned**  
- The role of communications in operational success cannot be overstated, highlighting the need for comprehensive training.
- Increasing pressure on students during training can enhance learning, but it is crucial to maintain professionalism to foster a positive learning environment.
- There is a point of diminishing returns when practicing the same basic skills repeatedly.

**Recommendations**  
1. **Expand Training Time**: Increase communications training duration by at least 5 days to cover essential subjects more thoroughly.
   - Continue teaching HAVEQUICK but also incorporate SINCGARS.
   - Include training on field-expedient and directional antennae, VRC-110, and PRC-150 systems for comprehensive communication skill development.
   - Ensure all necessary equipment is provided prior to the start of CT for effective kit development.

2. **Maintain Pressure with Professionalism**: Continue to increase stress during training but adhere to respectful practices.
   - Implement a troubleshooting training event using broken gear to foster confidence and calmness in students.

3. **Adjust Repetitiveness of Training**: Decrease repetitive practice of low-yield skills to maximize training effectiveness.
   - Diversify frequency practice by incorporating SINCGARS.

**Supporting Details**  
- Developing effective communication systems allows operatives to maintain operational integrity and enhances mission performance.
- Recommendations aim to systematize the learning experience, ensuring that all students acquire vital communications skills necessary for their success in the field.
