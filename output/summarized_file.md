### 1. Context
This memorandum aims to provide suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of communications training during the Core Tasks phase of Advanced Skills Training. The training is crucial for CCTs (Combat Control Teams) as effective communication is essential for mission success.

### 2. Key Findings
- The current curriculum for communications training is intense but lacks sufficient time allocated for thorough coverage of vital topics.
- The training is repetitive and does not build upon prior knowledge effectively.
- Increased pressure during training enhances students' ability to troubleshoot under stress but must be managed professionally.

### 3. Lessons Learned
- Communications are critical across all missions; without effective communication, operational effectiveness diminishes significantly.
- The ongoing training should incorporate realistic scenarios that allow students to engage with the equipment in a dynamic environment.
- Balancing depth and breadth in training is needed to ensure competencies are developed sufficiently.

### 4. Recommendations
- **Expand Training Time:** Increase the number of training days by at least 5 to allow more comprehensive coverage of communications topics.
  - Teach both HAVEQUICK and SINCGARS to provide students with essential skills for secure transmissions.
  - Include training on field-expedient and directional antennae and medium-range HF communication systems such as the PRC-150.
  
- **Enhance Practical Application:** Ensure that teams have the full kit issued before training begins and develop physical training evolutions that integrate shooting, moving, and communicating.

- **Maintain Instructor Pressure Professionally:** Keep the pressure on students to enhance learning, but ensure respect is maintained to foster a positive learning environment.  
  - Include a structured troubleshooting event with broken gear to elevate the training standard and build student confidence.

- **Reduce Redundancy in Training:** Limit the repetitiveness of specific frequency practices to avoid diminishing returns on training investment.

### 5. Relevant Supporting Details
- Current training only allocated 10 days, which is insufficient given the comprehensive nature of communications training required.
- SINCGARS waveforms, which are critical for ground combat formations, were not taught, while HAVEQUICK was unnecessarily emphasized.
- The lack of hardware troubleshooting instruction indicated a gap in the curriculum that could lead to deficiencies during actual operations.

**Conclusion:** Adjusting the training structure, improving the professional atmosphere of pressure applied during training, and refining the focus of the curriculum will enhance the effectiveness of communications training for Combat Control Teams, ultimately improving mission outcomes.
