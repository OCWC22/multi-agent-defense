**After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase**

**Context:**
- **Title:** After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase
- **Date:** 22 October 2015
- **From:** Captain Jeffrey D. Wright

**Key Findings:**
1. The current training duration of 10 days is insufficient for comprehensive communications training.
2. Essential topics like SINCGARS waveforms, field expedient antennae, and wave propagation theory were not adequately covered.
3. Instructor pressure enhanced learning but bordered on disrespectful.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Communications are crucial for the effectiveness of Combat Control Teams (CCTs); inadequate training compromises operational capabilities.
- Stressful training environments are beneficial for developing troubleshooting skills under pressure but must balance professionalism.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Increase Training Duration:**
   - Expand communications training by at least 5 days to allow for a detailed curriculum on key topics including SINCGARS and VRC-110 systems.

2. **Enhance Curriculum:**
   - Include comprehensive teaching on field-expedient and directional antennae, and detailed operating procedures for all communication systems relevant to CCT duties.

3. **Professional Development of Instructors:**
   - Maintain high-pressure training scenarios while ensuring professionalism and respect towards students.

4. **Implement Advanced Troubleshooting Events:**
   - Create dedicated events focused on troubleshooting skills using malfunctioning equipment under realistic scenarios.

5. **Reduce Repetitiveness in Training:**
   - Limit repetitive exercises on basic VULOS frequencies and integrate new frequency systems such as SINCGARS to maintain engagement and effectiveness.

**Supporting Details:**
- The training emphasizes essential communication skills, crucial for operational success, highlighting the need for robust training frameworks in core tasks.
- Practical demonstrations of equipment, troubleshooting methodologies, and respect during instruction are critical for developing a competent and capable team ready for operational challenges.
