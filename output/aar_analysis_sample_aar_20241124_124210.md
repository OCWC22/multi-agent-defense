**Date:** 22 October 2015  
**From:** Captain Jeffrey D. Wright  
**Subject:** After Action Report (AAR) for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase  

---

### Context
The purpose of this memorandum is to make suggestions for the continued effectiveness and improvement of communications training during the CT phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST). The report aims to address training deficiencies and propose actionable recommendations for future iterations of the training program.

### Key Findings
1. **Curriculum and Training Days Allocated**: Only 10 training days allocated, which is insufficient considering the critical role of communications in military operations.
2. **Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting**: Instructors successfully increased stress levels to highlight the importance of troubleshooting skills; however, improvement in the instruction of hardware troubleshooting is needed.
3. **Repetitiveness**: Effective in reinforcing fundamentals, but diminishing returns observed in practicing basic frequency jamming.

### Lessons Learned
- **Communications Training Needs**: The brevity of communications training periods does not allow for comprehensive education on essential topics such as SINCGARS waveforms and field expedient communications equipment.
- **Value of Increased Pressure**: Simulating stress during training conditions helps students adapt to real-world pressures, fostering stronger troubleshooting skills.
- **Balancing Practice**: While repetition is important, too much focus on one type of training may not yield proportional benefits.

### Recommendations
1. **Expand Training Duration**: Increase communications training by at least 5 days to cover essential topics thoroughly.
   - Include both HAVEQUICK and SINCGARS instruction.
   - Teach field-expedient and directional antennae alongside the VRC-110 system and PRC-150 for HF communication.
   - Ensure all students have a full complement of communication kit before the start of training.
   - Develop shooting and movement exercises that require effective communication.

2. **Maintain Pressure with Professionalism**: Retain the approach of a high-stress environment while ensuring respect and professionalism among instructors.
   - Implement specialized troubleshooting training:
     - Coordinate with a repair shop to provide broken gear for practical training.
     - Create stations for each student to troubleshoot equipment downtime.
     - Use real-case scenarios to enhance their troubleshooting skills and build confidence.

3. **Modify Frequency Practice**: Reduce repetitive practice of basic jamming exercises and incorporate a variety of frequencies, including SINCGARS, to enhance learning and mitigate diminishing returns.

### Supporting Details
- **Area of Improvement**: The report notes the absence of comprehensive training on SINCGARS waveforms, leading to a knowledge gap critical for operational readiness.
- **Example of Practice Implementation**: A training event conducted at ANGLICO highlighted effective methods of troubleshooting that can serve as a model for future training iterations.
