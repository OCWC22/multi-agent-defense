## Analysis Results

The After Action Report (AAR) dated 22nd October 2015, written by Captain Jeffrey D. Wright, highlights key observations and recommendations for improving the Communications Training during the Core Tasks (CT) phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST). 

Key Observations:
1. Scope of Curriculum and Training Days Allocated: The current training lasts only 10 days and fails to build upon earlier lessons. It also lacks coverage of SINCGARS waveforms and various aspects of communication such as field expedient antennae, directional antennae, vehicular communications, high frequency, and kit construction.
   
2. Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting: While the pressure tactics used by instructors were commendable for teaching students to troubleshoot under stress, there was a lack of instruction for troubleshooting hardware issues.

3. Repetitiveness: The training was highly repetitive, particularly with the hand-jamming basic VULOS frequencies, leading to diminishing returns after the fourth Training Day.

Recommendations:
1. Extend the training by at least five days and incorporate SINCGARS into the curriculum. This should include teaching of field-expedient and directional antennae, the VRC-110 system, and the PRC-150 for medium-range HF communication. Teams should be fully equipped with a kit issued to them before the start of CT.
   
2. Maintain instructor pressure but ensure professionalism. The training should also include a higher standard of troubleshooting, particularly for hardware issues.

3. Reduce the repetitiveness of the same type of frequency. Incorporating SINCGARS will help in this regard. 

The recommendations aim to enhance the effectiveness of the Communications Training and ensure a better return on investment.
