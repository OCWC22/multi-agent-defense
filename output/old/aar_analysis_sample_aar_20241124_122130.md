## Analysis Results

**After Action Report (AAR)**  
**Subject:** Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase  
**From:** Captain Jeffrey D. Wright  
**Date:** 22 October 2015

### Context
This AAR documents insights and suggestions for enhancing communications training during the Core Tasks (CT) phase of Advanced Skills Training (AST). The emphasis is on the efficacy and thoroughness of the current training regimen, particularly the critical role of communications in military operations.

### Key Findings
1. **Training Duration:** The allocated 10 training days for communications is inadequate given the fundamental importance of communication in maneuver and operations.
2. **Curriculum Gaps:** Key subject areas such as SINCGARS waveforms and field expedient antennae are not sufficiently covered.
3. **Instructor Effectiveness:** The increase in student pressure during training improved troubleshooting skills, though it sometimes bordered on disrespect.

### Lessons Learned
- Proper communications training is essential for operational success. Insufficient training for CCTs can lead to impaired mission capability.
- Constructive instructor pressure can enhance student performance and readiness, provided that professionalism is maintained.
- Repetitive practice can result in diminishing returns; a varied training approach is necessary to maintain engagement and effectiveness.

### Recommendations
1. **Expand Curriculum Duration:**
   - Increase the training period by at least 5 days to provide comprehensive coverage of essential topics.
   - Include SINCGARS in the curriculum alongside HAVEQUICK and provide in-depth training on hardware components and kit assembly.
  
2. **Professional Pressure Management:**
   - Continue the practice of increasing pressure during training but do so in a respectful manner.
   - Introduce structured troubleshooting exercises using broken or malfunctioning equipment to enhance practical learning.

3. **Reduce Repetitiveness:**
   - Limit repetitive training on basic frequency jamming to prevent diminishing returns and improve engagement.
   - Introduce new frequency types, including SINCGARS, to diversify training experiences.

### Supporting Details
- **Investments in Communication:** With communications being a critical asset for CCTs in various missions, expanding training resources aligns with strategic operational needs.
- **Implementation of Recommendations:** The AAR suggests implementing new training methodologies and equipment provisions before training commences to enhance overall effectiveness and soldier preparedness.
