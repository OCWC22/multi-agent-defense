## Analysis Results

Mission Overview: The AAR pertains to a communications training session during the Core Tasks phase of Advanced Skills Training. The training is intense and thorough, covering essential topics but given the significance of communication in the field, it's still under-resourced.

Key Lessons Learned:
1. Scope of Curriculum and Training Days Allocated - The training only spans 10 days, merely repeating and surpassing what was taught at CCS. It does not sufficiently cover SINCGARS waveforms, field expedient antennae, directional antennae, vehicular communications, high frequency, and kit construction. 

2. Instructor Pressure and Troubleshooting - The high-pressure environment created by the instructors is beneficial for the students as it teaches them to troubleshoot under pressure, however, it bordered on disrespectful at times. Also, while the instruction on troubleshooting programming was good, instruction on hardware was lacking.

3. Repetitiveness - While practice is vital, the training reached a point of diminishing returns quickly by emphasizing on the same type of frequency.

Critical Action Items: 
1. Extend this training by at least 5 additional days
2. Teach SINCGARS waveforms
3. Include a higher standard for troubleshooting training, with a specific process
4. Diminish repetitiveness by diversifying frequency types

Precautions: Maintain high-pressure training but ensure it remains respectful.

Recommendations: 
1. Expand the communications training by at least 5 additional days and include SINCGARS waveforms, field expedient and directional antennae, vehicular communications, high frequency, and kit construction in the curriculum.
2. Ramp up the pressure, but ensure it stays professional. Implement a unique training event to teach troubleshooting to a higher standard. 
3. Introduce more diversity into the frequency types used for practice to avoid a situation of diminishing returns.
