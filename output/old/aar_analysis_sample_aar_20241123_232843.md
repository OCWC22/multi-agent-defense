## Analysis Results

CAPTAIN JEFFREY D. WRIGHT's AAR for Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase outlines the need for improvements in the communications training in CT. He suggests that the training is intense and comprehensive but lacks the required time allocation. 

Key insights include:

1. The curriculum's scope and allocated training days need expansion. The current 10-day allocation does not sufficiently build on previous learning. The recommendation is to extend this training by at least five days and include additional components such as SINCGARS, field-expedient and directional antennae, the VRC-110 system, etc.

2. Instructor pressure and troubleshooting needs to be balanced. Stress levels are increased to teach troubleshooting under pressure, but the approach sometimes borders on disrespect. The recommendation is to maintain the pressure while keeping it professional and include a training event to teach troubleshooting to a higher standard.

3. The training becomes repetitive and reaches a point of diminishing returns quickly. The recommendation is to reduce the same type of frequency and include SINCGARS.

The AAR underscores the importance of communications in the career field and highlights the need for improvements in the existing training regimen.
