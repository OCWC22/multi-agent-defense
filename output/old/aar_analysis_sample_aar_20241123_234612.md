## Analysis Results

The After Action Report by Captain Jeffrey D. Wright on Communications Training, Core Tasks (CT) Phase highlights some key areas for improvement. The report suggests that the current training lacks the required depth and breadth due to time constraints. It recommends extending the training by at least 5 days and including the teaching of SINCGARS waveforms to enhance secure transmissions among ground combat formations. The report also emphasizes the need for maintaining high pressure on students while ensuring professionalism. This pressure is vital for teaching students to troubleshoot under stress. Finally, the report recommends reducing repetitiveness in the training, particularly with regards to hand-jamming basic VULOS frequencies. Instead, diversification of frequency types, including the addition of SINCGARS, is suggested.
